# CMPE 256 VAR Commodity Pricing Model - Gold & Silver

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a class presentation on the application of statistical methods and machine learning in forecasting commodity prices, specifically Gold and Silver. It explores the application of Granger’s Causality Test and the Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) Model, utilizing historical data on commodity prices and other economic indicators.

## Data
The analysis is based on historical data of the following economic indicators:
- Gold prices
- Silver prices
- Crude Oil prices
- Stock index
- Interest Rate
- USD rate

## Methodology
- Granger’s Causality Test is used to test the relationships of multiple variables in the time series.
- Vector Auto Regressive Model (VAR) is used to forecast the future prices of Gold and Oil.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Jupyter Lab or Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.
2. Install the required Python packages as specified in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and forecasts.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels

Please refer to the notebook for any additional dependencies.
